* <strong style="color:black;font-size:22px;"> Payroll taxes, wage rigidities and youth unemployment: Evidence from the Colombian labor market</strong> [[PDF]](https://danilo-aristizabal.github.io/research/youth_unemployment/taxes_and_youth_unemployment.pdf) with [Eduard Martínez](http://eduard-martinez.github.io)

 <p align="justify"> **Abstract:** This paper studies the effect of a payroll tax cut for new hires young workers under the age of
28 in Colombia on youth employment. We use differential degrees of exposure to wage rigidities to identify the effect. We measure an individual’s exposure to wage rigidities as the distance, in the city in which the individual lives, from the median salary by educational level in comparison
to the minimum wage. We have two different treatment groups and use a difference-in-difference model. The effect of reduced payroll taxes is asymmetric for youth who earn below and above the minimum wage. Reducing payroll taxes increased youth labor participation, rather than reducing
informality. </p>

* <strong style="color:black;font-size:22px;"> SARS-CoV-2 spread, detection, and dynamics in a megacity in Latin America </strong>[[PDF]](https://danilo-aristizabal.github.io/research/covid/SARS-CoV-2_spread_detection_and_dynamics_in_a_megacity_in_Latin_America.pdf) with [Rachid Laajaj](https://www.laajaj.com/), [Camilo De Los Rios](https://sites.google.com/view/cdelosriosru), [Ignacio Sarmiento-Barbieri](https://ignaciomsarmiento.github.io/), [Eduardo Behrentz](https://eduardobehrentz.com/), [Raquel Bernal](https://sites.google.com/view/raquelbernal/), [Giancarlo Buitrago](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Giancarlo-Buitrago), [Zulma Cucunubá](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/zulma.cucunuba), [Fernando de la Hoz], [Alejandro Gaviria], [Luis Jorge Hernández], [Leonardo León], [Diane Moyano], [Elkin Osorio], [Andrea Ramírez Varela], [Silvia Restrepo], [Rodrigo Rodriguez], [Norbert Schady] and [Martha Vives] (Submitted)

<p align="justify"> **Abstract:** In many developing countries, the COVID-19 pandemic has spread much faster and wider than the number of detected cases implies. By combining data from 59,770 RT-PCR tests on mostly asymptomatic individuals with administrative data on all detected cases, we capture the spread and dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in Bogota from June 2020 to early March 2021. Our data provide unusually broad and detailed information on mostly asymptomatic adults in Bogota, allowing to describe various features of the pandemic that appear to be specific to a developing country context. We fnd that, by the end of March 2021, slightly more than half of the population in Bogota has been infected, despite only a small fraction of this population being detected. In July 2020, after four months of generalized quarantine that mitigated the pandemic without curving it, the initial buildup of immunity contributed to the end of the first wave. We also show that the share of the population infected by February 2021 varies widely by occupation, socio-economic stratum, and location. This, in turn, has affected the dynamics of the spread: while the first wave of infections was driven by the lowest economic strata and highly-exposed occupations, the second peak affected the population more evenly. A better understanding of the spread and dynamics of the pandemic across different groups provides valuable guidance for efficient targeting of health policy measures and restrictions.

* <strong style="color:black;font-size:22px;"> Understanding inequalities in COVID-19 Infection across socioeconomic groups </strong>[]() with [Rachid Laajaj](https://www.laajaj.com/), [Duncan Webb](https://sites.google.com/view/duncan-webb/home),[Eduardo Behrentz](https://eduardobehrentz.com/), [Raquel Bernal](https://sites.google.com/view/raquelbernal/), [Giancarlo Buitrago](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Giancarlo-Buitrago), [Zulma Cucunubá](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/zulma.cucunuba), [Fernando de la Hoz], [Alejandro Gaviria], [Luis Jorge Hernández], [Camilo De Los Rios], [Andrea Ramírez Varela], [Silvia Restrepo], [Rodrigo Rodriguez], [Norbert Schady], [Martha Vives]

<p align="justify"> **Abstract:** Across the world, the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has disproportionately affected economically disadvantaged groups. This differential impact has numerous possible explanations, each with significantly different policy implications. We examine, for the first time in a low- or middle5
income country, which mechanisms best explain the disproportionate impact of the virus on the poor. Combining an epidemiological model with rich data from Bogota, Colombia, we show that total infections and inequalities in infections are largely driven by inequalities in the inability to work remotely and in within-home secondary attack rates. Inequalities in isolation behavior are less important but non-negligible, while access to testing and contract-tracing plays practically no role. Interventions that mitigate transmission are often more effective when targeted on socioeconomically disadvantaged groups.

* <strong style="color:black;font-size:22px;"> Concentration of the mobile phone market and countries' competitiveness </strong>[[PDF]](https://danilo-aristizabal.github.io/research/mobile_market/Concentration_of_the_Mobile_Market_in_Colombia.pdf) [[SSRN]](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3714775) (with [David Bardey](https://sites.google.com/site/davidbardey/), [Bibiana Sáenz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bibianasaenzbaquero/?originalSubdomain=co) and [Santiago Gómez](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jose_Gomez_Medina))

<p align="justify"> **Abstract:** The present study aims to shed light on the role of mobile phone markets’ concentration on countries’ competitiveness using a database that includes 59 countries and performing several estimations to find a causal relationship. Using an instrumental variable that aims to explain the degree of concentration in mobile phone markets, we find that the higher is the concentration in this industry, the lower is the use of the information technology and communication (ITC). On the other hand, we also find that the use of ITC is positively associated to countries' competitiveness. Thus, our results reveal pretty strong positive spillover effects of the mobile phone industry on countries' competitiveness. These results suggest that all policies that aim to reduce concentration and market power in the mobile phone industry may increase competitiveness.

* <strong style="color:black;font-size:22px;">Sovereign default and output volatility</strong> [[PDF]](https://danilo-aristizabal.github.io/research/sovereign_default/sovereign_default_and_output_volatility.pdf)

<p align="justify"> **Abstract:** High volatility in the economic conditions inside a country seem to be related with sovereign defaults. This paper studies how changes in the output process can explain default events in emerging economies. It establishes that economic conditions inside the country, all else equal, have significant impact on the default decisions. Nevertheless, It may also be driven jointly with other factors such as political risk or small output costs.
